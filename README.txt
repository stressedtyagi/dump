Hi Divyanshu ,

Please find my detailed  feedback for the year below :

Engineering Excellence:
Positive: He spends good amount of time in understanding the requirement and thinks about all possible scenarios that good be possible. That reflects on his code, and his work in most cases are complete when he comes for review. If he doesn’t have solution , he will ask and ensure that he covers the scenario before he announces his work done. He is always keen to experiment and learn new technology and tools. He has good coding style that is easier to maintain.
Scope of improvements: Well he being lesser experience, there is lot to learn. If he continues in his current way, he will be a good engineer. More knowledge in the AIML space, will help him and the team

Team payer:
Positive: Always ready to help, and does not shy away from taking responsibility. 
Scope of improvement: As he gains experience, we would like him to own a component or an area of work.


Managing stakeholder:
Positive: He has shown good ownership and responsibility during the ELA deployment. He was proactive in getting the things done by coordinating with different stakeholder, like raising RSAMS, etc. One notable thing was the Cassandra evaluation, where he coordinated with different groups to get the required inputs, that helped us to take the right decision at the right time.
Scope of improvement: Managing client deployment all alone, and participate in discussions with stakeholders.


General:
Positive: He is dedicated and always willing to learn. He does not shy away from challenges.
Scope of improvements: He can now start experimenting more. I sometimes feel he is scared of making mistakes. We should convey that it is ok to make mistakes and he should confidently execute his tasks and look a requirement wholistically.

I have demonstrated exceptional problem-solving abilities and a strong innovative mindset. My contributions to developing innovative solutions for key product modules like MMonitor, Mconsole, and Alerts have been highly impactful. Additionally, my work on AWS containerization and GKP onboarding for the Drona product has enabled significant platform adoption, showcasing my ability to drive meaningful business impact.

Business Results: Backend
I have exhibited a deep understanding of the MMonitor module, contributing valuable features such as Reference Stat generation and Feature Distribution. My architectural restructuring of the Mconsole backend and my creation of the GKP auth manager service from scratch highlight my technical expertise and my capability to lead complex backend initiatives.

Business Results: CI/CD
My leadership in the CI/CD domain is commendable. I have owned the Drona GKP infrastructure, writing the entire platform code, and made significant contributions to AWS upgrades and Drona deployments using Spinnaker. Additionally, I have coded CI/CD pipelines for both GKP and AWS across various Drona modules, greatly improving the reliability and efficiency of the company's software delivery processes.

Client/Customer/Stakeholder: Client/Customer/Stakeholder satisfaction
My support for the adoption and engagement efforts of the Drona product, through shadowing the main point of contact for ELA adoption, has been invaluable in addressing customer needs.

Client/Customer/Stakeholder: Communication and Collaboration
My strong communication and collaboration skills have been instrumental in working effectively with cross-functional teams, including project managers, designers, and quality assurance engineers. My constructive feedback during code reviews and my contributions to the Mconsole UI design have helped foster a culture of excellence and enhanced the overall user experience.

Teamwork and Leadership: Teamwork and Leadership
My ability to lead complex technical initiatives is commendable. I successfully led the development of the GKP auth manager service, building it from inception to production-ready code. My mentorship of a newly joined team member, helping them transition and understand the product codebase, has been invaluable in supporting the team's growth and development. My active participation in project planning and execution meetings, coupled with the insightful feedback I provided, have helped steer the team and product towards better progress.

Teamwork and Leadership: Technical Skill Development
My commitment to technical skill development is highly impressive. I have proactively learned new technologies like Kubernetes, CassandraDB, and MongoDB, expanding my expertise in critical areas. Additionally, I have deepened my proficiency in CI/CD practices and Python programming, which have significantly enhanced my ability to contribute innovative solutions and drive technological advancement within the team.
